Set Up the Project: Install Kivy and set up the project directory with necessary files (uno.kv for UI design and main.py for logic).
Card and Deck Classes: Define classes for cards and the deck. Each card has a color and value, and the deck contains all cards shuffled.
Player Class: Create a player class to manage each player's hand and actions like drawing and playing cards.
Game Logic: Implement the game rules, including handling special cards (e.g., Skip, Reverse, Draw Two).
User Interface: Design the game's interface using Kivy widgets like GridLayout, Label, and Button.
Interactivity: Link the game logic to the UI, enabling players to interact with the game by drawing and playing cards.
Enhancements: Add features like sound effects, animations, and AI opponents to improve gameplay.
These steps will help you build a basic but functional UNO game. Have fun coding and playing!
